# Twitter-Replica

With the help of two other group members, I developed a replica of Twitter using asp.NET
and SQL Server. The website has almost all of the features of the original twitter.com,
including the ability to tweet, message a follower, see trending hashtags, search a person or
tweet. In addition to this, "admin" functionality was also included, which allowed a privileged
user to view or delete any person or tweet.
